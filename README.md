# Chess Neural Network

The Chess Neural Network is a machine learning based chess engine that uses a neural networks to evaluate positions and then uses the Minimax algorithm to perform the decision making. In Chess, the term "adoption" refers to the concept of winning against a person for 10 consecutive games. With that in mind, my primary goal for this project is to create a chess engine that is good enough to "adopt" me. I have not set an ELO goal in mind but as I test different models and optimize the program, I will likely add a ELO goal for the model and test it on Lichess bots.

This project was inspired by Sebastian Lague and his chess series as well as from my CMSC 320 Data Science class at UMD. Thank you!

## Features

- Neural network-based position evaluation.
- Minimax algorithm for decision making.
- Training on large datasets with historical chess games.
- Also trained a model based on my own Lichess games.
- Evaluation and playing against human or computer opponents to determine ELO.
